Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker<nobr> microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

Using Appwrite, you can easily integrate your app with user authentication and multiple sign-in methods, a database for storing and querying users and team data, storage and file management, image manipulation, Cloud Functions, messaging, and [more services](https://appwrite.io/docs).

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with Appwrite is by [signing up for Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/). While Appwrite Cloud is in public beta, you can build with Appwrite completely free, and we won't collect you credit card information. 

## Self-Hosting

Appwrite is designed to run in a containerized environment. Running your server is as easy as running one command from your terminal. You can either run Appwrite on your localhost using docker-compose or on any other container orchestration tool, such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/).

Before running the installation command, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine:

### Unix

```bash
docker run -it --rm \               
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --volume "$(pwd)"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \
    --entrypoint="install" \
    appwrite/appwrite:latest
```

### Windows

#### CMD

```cmd
docker run -it --rm ^
    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    --volume "%cd%"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^
    --entrypoint="install" ^
    appwrite/appwrite:latest
```

#### PowerShell

```powershell
docker run -it --rm `
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
    --volume ${pwd}/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw `
    --entrypoint="install" `
    appwrite/appwrite:latest
```

Once the Docker installation is complete, go to http://localhost to access the Appwrite console from your browser. Please note that on non-Linux native hosts, the server might take a few minutes to start after completing the installation.

For advanced production and custom installation, check out our Docker [environment variables](https://appwrite.io/docs/environment-variables) docs. You can also use our public [docker-compose.yml](https://appwrite.io/install/compose) and [.env](https://appwrite.io/install/env) files to manually set up an environment.

### Upgrade from an Older Version

If you are upgrading your Appwrite server from an older version, you should use the Appwrite migration tool once your setup is completed. For more information regarding this, check out the [Installation Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting).

## One-Click Setups

In addition to running Appwrite locally, you can also launch Appwrite using a pre-configured setup. This allows you to get up and running quickly with Appwrite without installing Docker on your local machine.

## Architecture

![Appwrite Architecture showing how Appwrite is built and the services and tools it uses](docs/specs/overview.drawio.svg)

Appwrite uses a microservices architecture that was designed for easy scaling and delegation of responsibilities. In addition, Appwrite supports multiple APIs, such as REST, WebSocket, and GraphQL to allow you to interact with your resources by leveraging your existing knowledge and protocols of choice.

The Appwrite API layer was designed to be extremely fast by leveraging in-memory caching and delegating any heavy-lifting tasks to the Appwrite background workers. The background workers also allow you to precisely control your compute capacity and costs using a message queue to handle the load. You can learn more about our architecture in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture-1).

## Contributing

All code contributions, including those of people having commit access, must go through a pull request and be approved by a core developer before being merged. This is to ensure a proper review of all the code.

We truly :heart: pull requests! If you wish to help, you can learn more about how you can contribute to this project in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
