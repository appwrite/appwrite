# utopia PHP extension

Utopia crates registered as PHP classes. A class the extension registers has no PHP
source; the rest of its package (other classes, a stub for static analysis, tests)
stays in `packages/<name>`.

```sh
cargo build --release -p utopia-extension
php -d extension="$PWD/target/release/libutopia.so" ...   # libutopia.dylib on macOS
```

The Appwrite image builds and loads it:

```sh
docker compose exec appwrite php --ri utopia
```

Built on [ext-php-rs](https://github.com/extphprs/ext-php-rs); it needs `php-config`
and libclang at build time.

## Utopia\Image\Canvas and Utopia\Image\Font

Over `crates/utopia/image`, with the signatures in `packages/image/stubs/Canvas.php`. The value
objects a canvas takes (`Limits`, `Blank`, `Transform`, `Border`, `Point`, `Path`, `Text`) and the
`Format` and `Gravity` enums are plain PHP in `packages/image/src`; the binding reads their public
properties.

```php
$bytes = (new Canvas($data, new Limits(width: 16000, height: 16000)))
    ->apply(new Transform(width: 300, height: 300, border: new Border(2, '#ff0000'), radius: 20))
    ->encode(Format::Webp, quality: 80);
```

- **Immutable.** `apply()` and `draw()` return a new canvas that shares the source bytes. Both
  classes are final and readonly, with no static methods, and cannot be cloned or serialized.
- **Lazy.** The constructor reads the header: `width`, `height`, `orientation` and `format` cost
  no decode. `encode()` decodes, runs every step and writes the result in one pass, so a file with
  a sound header and damaged pixel data fails there.
- **Limits belong to a canvas.** Width, height and decoded bytes are bounded by the `Limits` it was
  made with (16,000 pixels a side and 512 MiB when none is given); there is no global setting and
  no "unlimited". `Limits::$formats` narrows which formats are read at all.
- **Bytes out only.** There is no method that writes to a path. No metadata is written.
- **Drawing.** `draw(new Path(...))` fills SVG path data; `draw(new Text(...))` draws one line from
  a `Font`, without kerning or shaping. That is how the fallback, initials and QR avatars are made.

`crates/extension/tests/canvas.php` runs without Composer; `packages/image/tests` is the full
suite, and is skipped where the extension is not loaded.

The extension turns on the crate's `libwebp` and `libheif` features, so it needs
libheif's headers to build (`libheif-dev`) and the library at run time; libwebp is
built from source. AVIF and HEIC follow the system's libheif: Appwrite's base image decodes both,
encodes AVIF, and has no HEVC encoder, so HEIC output is unavailable unless `libheif-x265`
(GPL-2.0-or-later) is installed.

How it behaves inside a Swoole worker:

- **Errors.** One hierarchy: `Exception\ImageException` and
  its `UnsupportedFormatException`, `CorruptImageException` and `LimitExceededException`
  for what an image or the system makes fail, `\InvalidArgumentException` for an argument
  that could never work. The classes load from the Composer package (without it they are
  `\Exception`).
- **Panics.** A panic in a Rust codec is caught and thrown as a PHP `Error` whose message
  starts with `Rust panic:`; the worker keeps running. The release profile must not set
  `panic = "abort"`.
- **Threads and forks.** The extension starts no thread pool. The pure-Rust AVIF encoder
  (the crate's default `ravif` feature) is left out: with its pool, a process that had
  encoded an AVIF and then forked left the child waiting forever on its next encode.


`crates/support/php-std` here holds only the functions `utopia-image` calls, copied
unchanged from the full crate on `feat/rust-utopia-conversion`.
