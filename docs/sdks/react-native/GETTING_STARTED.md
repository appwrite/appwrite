## Getting Started

### Add your Platform
If this is your first time using Appwrite, create an account and create your first project.

Then, under **Add a platform**, add a **Android app** or a **Apple app**. You can skip optional steps.

#### iOS steps
Add your app **name** and **Bundle ID**. You can find your **Bundle Identifier** in the **General** tab for your app's primary target in XCode.

#### Android steps
Add your app's **name** and **package name**, Your package name is generally the **applicationId** in your app-level [build.gradle](https://github.com/appwrite/playground-for-flutter/blob/master/android/app/build.gradle#L41) file.

## Setup

On `index.js` add import for `react-native-url-polyfill`

```
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto'
```

> If you are building for iOS, don't forget to install pods
> `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

### Init your SDK
Initialize your SDK with your Appwrite server API endpoint and project ID which can be found in your project settings page.

```js
import { Client } from 'react-native-appwrite';
// Init your Web SDK
const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
    .setProject('455x34dfkj') // Your project ID
    .setPlatform('com.example.myappwriteapp') // Your application ID or bundle ID.
;
```

### Make Your First Request
Once your SDK object is set, access any of the Appwrite services and choose any request to send. Full documentation for any service method you would like to use can be found in your SDK documentation or in the [API References](https://appwrite.io/docs) section.

```js
const account = new Account(client);

// Register User
account.create(ID.unique(), 'me@example.com', 'password', 'Jane Doe')
    .then(function (response) {
        console.log(response);
    }, function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });

```

### Full Example
```js
import { Client, Account } from 'react-native-appwrite';
// Init your Web SDK
const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
    .setProject('455x34dfkj')
    .setPlatform('com.example.myappwriteapp') // YOUR application ID
;

const account = new Account(client);

// Register User
account.create(ID.unique(), 'me@example.com', 'password', 'Jane Doe')
    .then(function (response) {
        console.log(response);
    }, function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });
```
