The Locale service allows you to customize your app based on your users' location. Using this service, you can get your users' location, IP address, list of countries and continents names, phone codes, currencies, and more. Country codes returned follow the [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) standard.

The user service supports multiple locales. This feature allows you to fetch countries and continents information in your app language. To switch locales, all you need to do is pass the 'X-Appwrite-Locale' header or set the 'setLocale' method using any of our available SDKs. [View here the list of available locales](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/master/app/config/locale/codes.php).
