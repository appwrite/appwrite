The Proxy service allows you to configure behavior for your attached domains. You can use proxy service to create rules that define what is returned on specific domains and subdomains.

Proxy Rules can be configured to serve Appwrite API, which allows you to comply with first-party cookies, making your website more secure. It can also be configured to serve Appwrite Function, which lets you accept incoming webhooks, build custom API endpoints, and serve static files.
