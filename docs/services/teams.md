The Teams service allows you to group users of your project and to enable them to share [read and write](https://appwrite.io/docs/permissions) access to your project resources, such as database documents or storage files.

Each user who creates a team becomes the team owner and can delegate the ownership role by inviting a new team member. Only team owners can invite new users to their team.
