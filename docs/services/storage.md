The Storage service allows you to manage your project files. Using the Storage service, you can upload, view, download, and query all your project files.

Each file in the service is granted with read and write permissions to manage who has access to view or edit it. You can also learn more about how to manage your [resources permissions](/docs/permissions).

The preview endpoint allows you to generate preview images of your files. Using the preview endpoint, you can also manipulate the resulting image so that it will fit perfectly inside your app in terms of dimensions, file size, and style. The preview endpoint also allows you to change the resulting image file format for better compression or image quality for better delivery over the network.
