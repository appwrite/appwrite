Use this endpoint to complete the user account password reset. Both the **userId** and **secret** arguments will be passed as query parameters to the redirect URL you have provided when sending your request to the [POST /account/recovery](https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web-default#accountCreateRecovery) endpoint.

Please note that in order to avoid a [Redirect Attack](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md) the only valid redirect URLs are the ones from domains you have set when adding your platforms in the console interface.
