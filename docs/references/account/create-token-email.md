Sends the user an email with a secret key for creating a session. If the email address has never been used, a **new account is created** using the provided `userId`. Otherwise, if the email address is already attached to an account, the **user ID is ignored**. Then, the user will receive an email with the one-time password. Use the returned user ID and secret and submit a request to the [POST /v1/account/sessions/token](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#createSession) endpoint to complete the login process. The secret sent to the user's email is valid for 15 minutes.

A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn more about session limits](https://appwrite.io/docs/authentication-security#limits).
