Allow the user to login to their account using the [OAuth2](/docs/client/account#accountCreateOAuth2Session) provider of their choice. Each OAuth2 provider should be enabled from the Appwrite console first. Use the success and failure arguments to provide a redirect URL's back to your app when login is completed.

If there is already an active session, the new session will be attached to the logged-in account. If there are no active sessions, the server will attempt to look for a user with the same email address as the email received from the OAuth2 provider and attach the new session to the existing user. If no matching user is found - the server will create a new user.

A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn more about session limits](/docs/authentication#limits).
