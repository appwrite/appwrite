Sends the user an email with a temporary secret key for password reset. When the user clicks the confirmation link he is redirected back to your app password reset URL with the secret key and email address values attached to the URL query string. Use the query string params to submit a request to the [PUT /account/recovery](/docs/client/account#accountCreateRecovery) endpoint to complete the process. The verification link sent to the user's email address is valid for 1 hour.
