Use this endpoint to allow a new user to register an anonymous account in your project. This route will also create a new session for the user. To allow the new user to convert an anonymous account to a normal account, you need to update its [email and password](/docs/client/account#accountCreateAnonymousSession) or create an [OAuth2 session](/docs/client/account#accountCreateOAuth2Session).
