Use this endpoint to allow a new user to register an anonymous account in your project. This route will also create a new session for the user. To allow the new user to convert an anonymous account to a normal account, you need to update its [email and password](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#updateEmail) or create an [OAuth2 session](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#CreateOAuth2Session).
