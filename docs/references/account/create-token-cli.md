Initiates a browser-based authentication flow for CLI applications. This endpoint generates a token that allows users to authenticate from their browser and then return to the CLI with valid credentials. The user will be redirected to their browser where they can complete the authentication process. Once authenticated, the secret and userId will be made available to the CLI application. Use the returned user ID and secret and submit a request to the [POST /v1/account/sessions/token](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#createSession) endpoint to complete the login process. The token is valid for 15 minutes.

A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn more about session limits](https://appwrite.io/docs/authentication-security#limits).
