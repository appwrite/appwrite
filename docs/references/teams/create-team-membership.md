Use this endpoint to invite a new member to join your team. If the request is initiated from the Client SDK, an email with a link to join the team will be sent to the new member's email address. If the member doesn't exist in the project it will be created automatically. Otherwise, if the request is initiated from server side SDKs, the new member will be automatically added to the team.

Use the 'URL' parameter to redirect the user from the invitation email back to your app. When the user is redirected, use the [Update Team Membership Status](/docs/client/teams#teamsUpdateMembershipStatus) endpoint to allow the user to accept the invitation to the team.  While calling it from server side SDKs the redirect url can be an empty string.

Please note that in order to avoid [Redirect Attacks](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md) the only valid redirect URL's are the ones from domains you have set when adding your platforms in the console interface.
