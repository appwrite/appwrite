Use this endpoint to capture a screenshot of any website URL. This endpoint uses a headless browser to render the webpage and capture it as an image.

You can configure the browser viewport size, theme, user agent, geolocation, permissions, and more. Capture either just the viewport or the full page scroll.

When width and height are specified, the image is resized accordingly. If both dimensions are 0, the API provides an image at original size. If dimensions are not specified, the default viewport size is 1280x720px.
