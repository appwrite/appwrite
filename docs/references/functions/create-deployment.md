Create a new function code deployment. Use this endpoint to upload a new version of your code function. To execute your newly uploaded code, you'll need to update the function's deployment to use your new deployment UID.

This endpoint accepts a tar.gz file compressed with your code. Make sure to include any dependencies your code has within the compressed file. You can learn more about code packaging in the [Appwrite Cloud Functions tutorial](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions).

Use the "command" param to set the entrypoint used to execute your code.
