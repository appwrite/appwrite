Get the top-level streaming manifest for a video output: an HLS master playlist (`master.m3u8`) or a DASH MPD (`master.mpd`). Hand this URL to a player to begin adaptive playback.

Guests can request this URL when they hold `videos.play` (or `videos.read`) **and** the video document grants them read. A video with `read("any")` or `read("guests")` is playable without a session.

For `output=cmaf`, both masters are available under `/outputs/cmaf/` and point at the same fMP4 segment set.
