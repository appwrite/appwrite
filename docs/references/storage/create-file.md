Create a new file. Before using this route, you should create a new bucket resource using either a [server integration](/docs/server/storage#storageCreateBucket) API or directly from your Appwrite console.

Larger files should be uploaded using multiple requests with the [content-range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range) header to send a partial request with a maximum supported chunk of `5MB`. The `content-range` header values should always be in bytes.

When the first request is sent, the server will return the **File** object, and the subsequent part request must include the file's **id** in `x-appwrite-id` header to allow the server to know that the partial upload is for the existing file and not for a new one.

If you're creating a new file using one of the Appwrite SDKs, all the chunking logic will be managed by the SDK internally.
