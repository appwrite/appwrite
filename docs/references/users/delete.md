Delete a user by its unique ID, thereby releasing it's ID. Since ID is released and can be reused, all user-related resources like documents or storage files should be deleted before user deletion. If you want to keep ID reserved, use the [updateStatus](https://appwrite.io/docs/server/users#usersUpdateStatus) endpoint instead.
