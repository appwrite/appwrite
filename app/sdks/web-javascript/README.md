Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way.
                        Use the JavaScript SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

// Init your JS SDK
var appwrite = new Appwrite();
