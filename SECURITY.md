# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Appwrite welcomes responsible security research and is committed to keeping our users, data, and infrastructure safe.

## Contact

We only accept **Email**â€‚reports. Please use this address for all vulnerability reports: security@appwrite.io  

Do **not** open public GitHub issues for security problems.

## In Scope

| Category           | Included |
|--------------------|----------|
| Production domains | `*.appwrite.io`, `*.appwrite.network`, `*.appwrite.run` |
| Open-source repos  | Everything under `github.com/appwrite/*` or `github.com/utopia-php/*`|

## Out of Scope

* Third-party integrations
* Rate-limit or brute-force findings 
* Self-XSS or clickjacking on static marketing pages
* Missing SPF, DMARC, or DKIM records without an exploitable impact
* Vulnerabilities in dependencies with no viable exploit path

---

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action or law-enforcement involvement for research that:

1. Targets only systems listed as in scope  
2. Respects user privacy and does not exfiltrate data  
3. Avoids service degradation or denial of service  
4. Allows us reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure  

---

## Reporting Format

Include the following for fastest triage:

* Clear title and summary of the issue
* Step-by-step reproduction or proof-of-concept
* Impact assessment
* Affected endpoint, repo, or component
* Suggested remediation if known

Screenshots and detailed logs are appreciated.

---

## Recognition

Appwrite currently offers non-monetary recognition.

Discretionary swag bounties may be awarded when budget allows but are not guaranteed.

---

## Duplicate Handling

First valid report gets credit. Later duplicates are closed as duplicates.

---

## Public Disclosure

Please wait until either the fix is live or 90 days have passed since our acknowledgment, whichever comes first, before publishing details. Extensions can be arranged by mutual agreement.

---

## Prohibited Actions

* Social engineering Appwrite core team or customers
* Physical attacks on offices or data centers
* Volumetric denial of service
* Automated scanning that degrades service for other users

---

Thank you for helping keep Appwrite secure.
