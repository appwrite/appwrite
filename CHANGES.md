### Upgrading
- Appwrite Cloud is not yet updated to 1.5.x, expect an announcement in the upcoming weeks. If you lock your Appwrite SDK version, this update is not breaking.
- Follow the [self-hosted docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/update) to update your self-hosted Appwrite.
- Update your SDKs to the latest versions. The API is backwards compatible, using old SDKs will not break existing apps, but you will not have access to new features.
