# 🚀 Appwrite API Playground


This collection is designed to help you explore, test, and understand Appwrite APIs in a structured and practical way.

---

## 📌 What This Is About

This playground serves as a hands-on environment to:

- Explore core Appwrite services  
- Test API endpoints with real requests  
- Understand authentication flows  
- Learn request & response structures  
- Simulate real-world backend use cases  

Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, or backend service, this collection helps you understand how Appwrite works under the hood.

## 🛠 What We Are Going To Do Here

Inside this playground, we will:

### 🔐 1. Authentication
- Create users  
- Login / Logout users  
- Manage sessions  
- Test JWT & API key authentication  

### 🗂 2. Database Operations
- Create databases & collections  
- Add, update, delete documents  
- Query documents with filters  

### 📦 3. Storage
- Upload files  
- Retrieve file previews  
- Manage file permissions  

### ⚡ 4. Functions (Serverless)
- Deploy & trigger functions  
- Execute functions via API  
- Test event-driven workflows  

### 👥 5. Teams & Permissions
- Create teams  
- Add members  
- Manage roles & access control

## 🎯 Goal of This Playground

By the end of this collection, you will:

- Understand how Appwrite APIs are structured  
- Be comfortable making authenticated API calls  
- Know how to integrate Appwrite into real applications  
- Have reusable request templates for future projects

## 💡 How to Use This Collection

1. Set up your environment variables (Project ID, API Key, Endpoint).  
2. Follow requests in order (Authentication → Database → Storage → Functions).  
3. Inspect request bodies and responses carefully.  
4. Modify payloads to experiment and learn.
